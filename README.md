Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js: v16 or higher
npm: v8 or higher
Git: Latest stable version

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/vipulsangwan771/react_chatSystem.git
cd react_chatSystem


Install Dependencies:

Backend:cd server
npm install


Frontend:cd client
npm install




Configure Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the server/ directory:
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000


Run the Application:

Backend:cd server
node index.js


Frontend:cd client
npm start

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:5000



How It Works

Socket.IO: Establishes real-time WebSocket connections for users joining the chat.
Messaging: Broadcasts messages instantly to all connected clients.
Real-time Updates: Ensures seamless message delivery without page refreshes.
Backend: Manages user sessions, socket events, and message distribution.

Screenshots
Modern chat interface with real-time messaging.
Note: Replace client/public/screenshot.png with an actual screenshot or GIF.
Deployment
Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)

Push the client/ directory to a Git repository.
Connect to Vercel or Netlify.
Set build command: npm run build, output directory: build.

Backend (Render/Heroku/Railway)

Push the server/ directory to a Git repository.
Configure the platform to run node index.js.
Add environment variables (PORT, CLIENT_URL) in the platform dashboard.
Ensure WebSocket support for Socket.IO.

Note: Update CORS settings in server/index.js to include the production frontend URL.
Testing
Note: Testing is not yet implemented. Consider adding Jest for frontend or Mocha for backend tests.
To run tests (if added):
cd client
npm test

Troubleshooting

CORS Errors: Verify CLIENT_URL matches the frontend URL in the backend .env.
Port Conflicts: Change PORT in the backend .env if 5000 is occupied.
Socket.IO Issues: Confirm WebSocket support on your hosting platform.

Future Enhancements

User authentication (JWT/OAuth)
Private chats and group rooms
File sharing (images, PDFs)
Typing indicators and read receipts
