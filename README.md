Node.js: v16 or higher

npm: v8 or higher

Git: Latest stable version

📦 Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/vipulsangwan771/react_chatSystem.git
cd react_chatSystem
Install Dependencies

Backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
npm install
Frontend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../client
npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the server/ directory:

ini
Copy
Edit
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
🚀 Run the Application
Backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
node index.js
Frontend:

cd client
npm start
🔗 Access the app at:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:5000

⚙️ How It Works
Socket.IO establishes real-time WebSocket connections for users.

Messages are broadcasted instantly to all connected clients.

Live updates without page refresh.

Backend handles user sessions, socket events, and message distribution.

📍 Note: Replace client/public/screenshot.png with a real screenshot or GIF.

🚀 Deployment
Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
Push the client/ folder to your Git repo.

Connect your repo to Vercel or Netlify.

Set:

Build command: npm run build

Output directory: build

Backend (Render/Heroku/Railway)
Push the server/ folder to your Git repo.

Configure the server to run node index.js.

Add required environment variables (PORT, CLIENT_URL).

Ensure WebSocket support is enabled.

🛡️ Important: Update CORS settings in server/index.js to allow your frontend production URL.

🧪 Testing
🧪 Testing is not yet implemented. You can consider adding Jest (frontend) or Mocha (backend) in the future.

To run tests (when added):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm test
🛠 Troubleshooting
❌ CORS Errors: Ensure CLIENT_URL matches your frontend's actual URL.

⚠️ Port Conflicts: Modify PORT in the backend .env if 5000 is already in use.

🔌 Socket.IO Issues: Confirm your hosting platform supports WebSockets.

🌱 Future Enhancements
🔐 User authentication (JWT/OAuth)

👥 Private chats and group rooms

🖼️ File sharing (images, PDFs)

✍️ Typing indicators and read receipts
